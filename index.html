                <h4>Vetted Apartments</h4>
                <p>
                    When an apartment is posted on our platform by the Home-Owner, the status of that apartment to set to be 'under review' which gives our users the clear perspective that the apartment is not yet verified. The 'admin' is responsible for changing the status of the apartment to 'verified' after a thorough assessment has been made to verify the authenticity of the apartment.

                <p>
                    The search filter makes it easy for our users to filter through the  thousands of posted apartments in order to narrow their search based on their preferred apartment choice. This will prevent users sorting endlessly through the available apartments looking for their preferred home.

                    You are not ready to pay for the apartment just yet? No problem! We've got you covered with the save to favorites feature. This feature allows users to save any lodge that they are interested in to favorites to prevent going back to look for that apartment. The apartment will remain available as long as someone else has not yet taken it.

            <h3>Project Inspiration</h3>
            <p>
                The inspiration for this project was born out of the frustration people pass through to get apartment especially those that relocate from one city to another. This project is particularly targeted at University Students and NYSC participants. These are the category of people that frequently have to relocate to other cities and one of the major challenges that they usually face is the problem of getting decent accommodation at a fair price. Most times, many people fall victims to fraudsters who pose as agents. This project will drastically reduce those anomalies.
